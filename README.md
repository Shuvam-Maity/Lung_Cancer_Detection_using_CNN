# Lung_Cancer_Detection_using_CNN

This project applies deep learning techniques to detect lung cancer from medical imaging using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It leverages the power of CNNs to automatically learn and extract spatial features from image data, enabling early and accurate classification of cancerous and non-cancerous lung scans.

The objective is to build a robust, end-to-end deep learning model that can assist radiologists in identifying signs of lung cancer in chest X-ray or CT images, thereby aiding early diagnosis and improving treatment outcomes.
